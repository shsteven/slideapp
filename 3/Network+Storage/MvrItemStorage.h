#pragma mark Reading from item storage
// These methods are independent of the actual kind of storage (in memory or on disk) used for this storage.
// The above means that if you call -data and the item was saved on a file on disk, it will be loaded. This is usually not the desired behavior if the item is big. See below for opportunistic reading methods.

@property(copy) NSData* data;

// The whole content of the storage as a NSData object. (For info on setting, see below in the 'Writing' section.)
- (NSData*) data;

// The path to an app-accessible file on disk that contains the item's contents. Exists for as long as this object does if no undue interference happens.
// The path may change from time to time after it has been returned if you interact with this object (notably, if you use the storage central to save it, or if you use -setPathExtension: or -setPathExtensionAssumingType:). KVO'able.
- (NSString*) path;

// YES if this object has written data to a path on disk, NO if it only exists in memory (and would be offloaded by a call to -path).
@property(readonly) BOOL hasPath;

// A new input stream reading from the content of the storage. Always just-constructed and unopened.
- (NSInputStream*) inputStream;

// Opportunistic reading. These methods are used to choose a "good", performance-wise and memory-wise, way to access the storage's content.

// Returns the 'best' way you can access the storage's contents. This is either a NSData or a NSInputStream object. Roughly speaking, if the object is already entirely in memory, it will exploit this by returning the NSData object; but if not, it will instead return a stream to that data on disk (or wherever it is stored).
// If it returns an input stream, it will always return it just-constructed and unopened (just like -inputStream).
- (id) preferredContentObject;

// Returns a NSData object if the contentLength is equal or less to the limit, otherwise nil.
- (NSData*) dataIfLengthIsAtMost:(unsigned long long) maximumLength;

#pragma mark Writing to item storage
// All writing methods clear whatever contents the item storage previously held when called.

// Returns an unopened output stream. Write to this stream to set the contents of the item storage. The size for ...OfAssumedSize: will be used as a hint to the item storage to choose where to store what is written to the stream. Otherwise, if the size is unknown but the order of magnitude is, you can use ...ForStorageIn: to choose where to save the stream yourself.
// Note that being wrong about the size passed to ...OfAssumedSize: may lead to out-of-memory crashes if more data is written on the stream than what was given, so it's important to get it right or at least overestimate conservatively.
// Same with ...ForStorageIn:. If you don't know how big it is, save to disk (kMvrStorageDestinationDisk) or you might run into crashes.
// When you have finished writing to the stream and closed it, you MUST call the -endUsingOutputStream method to let the item storage take ownership of the data you wrote.
// It's a programmer error to use ANY method or access ANY property of this object before calling -endUsingOutputStream (except calling that method, of course) OR to call it before closing the stream. Behavior is undefined in either case.
- (NSOutputStream*) outputStreamForContentOfAssumedSize:(unsigned long long) size;
- (NSOutputStream*) outputStreamForStorageIn:(MvrStorageDestination) destination;
- (void) endUsingOutputStream;

// Setting the .data property causes the whole content of the storage item to be reset to whatever you passed. Depending on the length of the data, it might immediately be written to disk rather than keeping a copy in memory (with similar size limits than those used for outputStreamForContentOfAssumedSize:).
- (void) setData:(NSData*) data;

// The first method below changes the path on disk so that it ends with the specified extension. This is useful for interacting with other libraries that expect the path to end in a certain way (I'm looking at you, MPMoviePlayerController!). Do not include the dot. (eg: @"mp4", @"txt".)
// The extension is kept if the path changes due to some automatic operation of MvrItemStorage (for example, moving an item from temporary to persistent on-disk storage).
// Note that this operation is equivalent to requesting the value of the .path property in terms of timing -- this means that if a path didn't exist yet, data will be written to disk to make one. Use with care.
// The second method is a convenience method that calls the first with the default extension for the given UTI.
- (BOOL) setPathExtension:(NSString*) ext error:(NSError**) e;
- (BOOL) setPathExtensionAssumingType:(id) uti error:(NSError**) e;

// This method is only for use in garbage-collected environments and from the main thread only. It indicates that the storage is to be invalidated immediately, removing any resource it may be managing (for instance, files on disk or data in memory). This clears the storage.
// GC apps must call this method at least once, and call no methods that cause .path to be invoked, before the last reference to this object is lost. It is only valid to call this method on non-persistent object, since the storage central references those objects.
- (void) invalidate;

// This method has two purposes:
// - if the item has a path, it sets its extension the same way setPathExtension:error: does.
// - if the item has no path, it stores the extension instead. Any automatic creation of a path (eg. by accessing .path) will produce a path with that extension.
// Unlike setPathExtension..., calling any of these methods does NOT cause data to be written to disk.
// The ...assumingType: variant will work just like the above but with setPathExtensionAssumingType:error:. (The extension will be determined at the time you call setDesiredExtensionAssumingType:....)
- (BOOL) setDesiredExtension:(NSString*) ext error:(NSError**) e;
- (BOOL) setDesiredExtensionAssumingType:(id) uti error:(NSError**) e;

#pragma mark Managing persistency of items.
// PLEASE NOTE: These methods replace the use of direct access methods (kMvrItemStorageAllowFriendMethods) below.

// Makes this object persistent. This means it will offload its contents to disk at the specified path and will make sure no modifications happen to the file as a result of using this class's methods.
- (BOOL) makePersistentByOffloadingToPath:(NSString*) p error:(NSError**) e;

// Makes this object not persistent. The contents of this object will be reset to an empty buffer. The file at the previous offload path (as returned by .path, if any, before calling this method) will not be touched.
